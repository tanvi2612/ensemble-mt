You can handle this case
Would you care to tell me what the hell that was all about back there ?
I come home to find you taking a bath with your dolls ...
He runs the simulations !
So you &apos;re worried about what people will think ?
Brigadeführer , what can I do for you ?

Not again !
Good to know . You can get it yourself .
Him and this tasty bitch he was with ?
Daddy .
Finished second in school .
Hmm ?
Open that thing !
Do it again .
And from that day he earned himself a name that would ... haunt me for the rest of my days .
Such a shame we had to tell all those little white lies .

This isn &apos;t a defense mechanism , it &apos;s a weapon !
No , she &apos;s at home , looking after my little sister
Now I &apos;m scared for my daughter and want her by my side .
As in pay any tax .
I think we should hire a ... you know , a Frank Sinatra-type , uh , lead singer ... as opposed to a James Brown-type lead singer ... because , you know , really , let &apos;s be honest , there &apos;s only oneJames Brown ... and , you know , a faux James Brown is really quite intolerable .
Now , I &apos;d imagine those little boys of yours are always keeping you on your toes , right , Lorna ?
